# GIRFbench

GIRFbench is a collection of tools and sequences for measuring, processing, and comparing gradient impulse repsonse functions (GIRF).

## Structure

**./pseq_helpers/** contains Python helper classes for constructing the GIRF sequencesusing pypulseq

**./acquire/**  contains Python utilities and notebooks that show how different GIRF acquisitions can be generated

**./process/**  contains Python utilities and notebooks that generate GIRFs from the acquired data
